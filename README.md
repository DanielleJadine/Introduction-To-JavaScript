# Introduction-To-JavaScript
DAY 1
What is Javascript?
-JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming language in the world ,it is also one of the three pilars of the web of whic the other two are CSS and HTML .
-JavaScript was purposely designed to intergrate into HTML.
What does JavaScript do?
-It programs around the web 
-Creates interactivity (allows things that were previously in the early days of the web generally static)
JavaScipt Variables
-We define variables with the keword> var
-Variables are containers for storing dta which can be declared in 4 ways
1. Automatically
2. Using var
3. Using let
4. Using const
-Var was used or elemented in 1995 -2015, let and const were added in 2015 however var should only be used in code written for older browser.
Increment(++)
-The increment operator adds one to its operand and returns a value.
Syntax
-Operator: x++ or ++x
Decrement(--)
-The decrement operator subtracts one from its operand and returns a vales
-Variables hold values
example using let               example using const                   mixed example
let x= 5;                        const x= 5;                          const 5;
let y=6;                         const y= 6;                          const 6;
let z=x+y;                       const z= x+y                          let total= price1 + price2
-variables price 1 and price 2 are declared with the const keyword ,these constant values cannot be changed
Syntax
-Operator: x-- or --x
One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports , these are the types of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language .
JavaScript Comments
-can be used to explain Javascript code and to make it more readable ,JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent excecution when testing alternative code.
Single Line Comments
-single line comments start with // and any text between // and the end of the line with be ignored by JavaScript it will not be executed
Multi Line Comments
-start with /* and end with*/ and any text between /* and */ will be ignored by javascript
JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types which are -
   -Number e.g 123, 120.50 etc
   -Strings of text e.g "This text string " etc
   -Boolean e.g true or false
   JavaScript also defines two trival data types null and undefined each of which defines only a single value ,in addition to these primitve data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as a object.
   * Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization once for the life of any variable name in a document ,you should not re-declare the same variable twice.
  JavaScrpt is an untyped language ,this means that a variable can hold a value of any data type unlike many other languages you dont have to tell JavaScript during a variable declaration what type of value the variable will hold ,the value tpe of a variable can chnage during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.
JavaScript Identifers
-All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names , and these unique names are called identifers these can also be short names like x and y or even more descriptive names like age ,sum or total volume
General rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifers) are:
-names can contai letters ,digits , underscores ,and dollar signs
-names must begin with a letter
-names can also begin with - and $
-reserved words cannot be used as names
*identifers are case-sensitive
JavaScript Assignment
The Addition Assignment Operator
-In JavaScript the equal sign(=) is an "assignment" operator
x= x+5
-it assigns the value of x + 5  to x
-it calculates the value of x+5 and puts the result into x ,the value of x is incremented by 5
-Adds value to a variable
The Subtration Assignment Operator
-subtracts value from a variable
let x = 10;
x -= 5;
Data Types(JavaScript)
-JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like like "John Doe"
-In programming ,text values are called text strings , strings are written inside double or single quotes and numbers are written without quotes , if you written in quotes it will be treated as a text string .
Declaring a JavaScript Variable
-creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable , you can declare a variable with var or let .
-after declaration the variable has no value (technically it is undefined) , to assign a vaue to the variable use the equal sign.
-you can declare many variables in one statement start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma, a declaration can span multiple lines.
Value= Undefined
-In computer programmes variables are often declared without a value ,the value can be something that has to be calculated or something that will be provided later like user input
-A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined
RE-declaring JavaScript Variables
- If you re-daclare a JavaScript  variable declared with var it will not lose its value
